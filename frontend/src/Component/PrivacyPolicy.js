        <h1>4. Information Security and Storage</h1>
        <p>
          We use commercially reasonable measures to provide the Services.
          However, you acknowledge that no security safeguards or method of
          transmission over the Internet are completely secure, and although we
          believe the measures implemented by us reduce the likelihood of
          security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved,
          we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information
          transmitted to or from our Services. Any transmission of personal
          Information is at your own risk. We do not guarantee that your
          personal information will not be misused by third parties. We are not
          responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security
          features. You agree that we will not have any liability for the
          misuse, access, acquisition, deletion, or disclosure of your personal
          Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The safety and security of your personal information also depend on
          you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for
          access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for
          keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your
          password with anyone.

          If you believe that your personal information has been accessed or

          that we can quickly take necessary measures.

        <h1>5. Data Retention</h1>
        <p>
          We store personal information for as long as reasonably required for
          its purpose or for any additional period required or allowed by
          applicable law (if any). The length of time for which we retain
          personal information depends on the purposes for which we collect and
          use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws. By our
          routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain
          Information you have submitted to us. We are under no obligation to
          store such Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising
          out of, or related to, the destruction of such Information.

        <p>
          To exercise any of the rights described above, please submit a
          verifiable consumer request to us via the methods described below. The
          verifiable consumer request must:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected Information or an
            authorized representative; and

          require you to provide certain information to verify your identity
          before granting you access to your Information or complying with your

          pieces of Information, we may require you to sign a declaration under
          penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Information is the
          subject of the request. Only you or your authorized agent may make a
          verifiable consumer request related to your Information. If you
          designate an authorized agent to request on your behalf, we may
          require you to provide the authorized agent written permission to do
          so and to verify your own identity directly with us (as described
          above). You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of
          your minor child.
