          20. ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE
          REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
        </h1>
        <p className="fs-5">
          A. Arbitration Notice <br />
          You and we agree that if there is any dispute or claim arising from or
          related to the Services and/or these Terms of Service (except for
          Exempt Claims, as defined below), it will be resolved by confidential
          binding arbitration, rather than in court, after first giving Notice
          of the Dispute (“Notice”) to the other party and the opportunity to
          discuss resolution within thirty (30) days of such Notice. The Notice
          should be sent to: 227 Lewis Wharf Boston, MA 02110. This Notice must
          include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party
          is asserting, and the relief sought.
          <br />
          If you and we are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice
          within thirty (30) days after the Notice is sent, you or we may
          initiate arbitration proceedings. There is no judge or jury in
          arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
          However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
          damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory
          relief or statutory damages) and must follow the provisions of these
          Terms of Service as a court would. There is no judge or jury in
          arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
          However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
          damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory
          relief or statutory damages) and must follow the provisions of these
          End User Terms as a court would. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE
          VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND
          TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.
          <br />
          The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply, and the
          American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration
          under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
          Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Payment of all filing,
          administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s
          rules.
          <br />
          The arbitration shall be held in the State of Massachusetts or at
          another mutually agreed location. If the arbitration involves a
          consumer, the arbitration will be held at a location convenient to the
          consumer. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or
          we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based
          solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you
          and us, subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person
          hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person
          hearing may be made by telephone by you and us unless the arbitrator
          requires otherwise.
          <br />
          The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims by the laws of
          the State of Massachusetts, including recognized principles of equity,
          and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by applicable law.
          The arbitrator will also decide any questions relating to the
          interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this arbitration
          clause, except where a party files a claim in court because it is an
          Exempt Claim (as defined below). If either party files an Exempt
          Claim, the court presiding over that claim will determine if the claim
          is an Exempt Claim under this Arbitration Clause. The arbitrator’s
          award shall be confidential, final, and binding, and judgment on the
          award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof.
          <br />
          Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the
          contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Section
          (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided
          herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that
          was filed in a proceeding against us before the effective date of the
          change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Section, any such
          termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the
          version of these Terms of Service containing this Section is posted to
          the websites and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed
          in a proceeding against us before the effective date of termination.
          <br />
          CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US
          WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR
          RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE
          ARBITRATION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than
          in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both
          agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or
          other misuse of intellectual property rights.
          <br />
          EXEMPT CLAIMS: You and the Company agree that the following two types
          of claims are not required to be submitted to an arbitration subject
          to the following conditions:
          <br />
          (1) You or we are not required to arbitrate a claim brought on an
          individual basis in small-claims court. However, if (a) there is an
          appeal from the small-claims court, or (b) a change in the claim that
          renders the small-claims court unable to resolve the claim, then the
          claim must be resolved in an arbitration under the terms of this
          Arbitration Provision. (2) You or we are not required to arbitrate a
          claim brought on an individual basis to enjoin infringement or other
          misuse of intellectual property rights. Such a claim may be brought in
          any court of competent jurisdiction. You and We agree that the
          infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights could
          cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are an inadequate
          remedy. The prevailing party in an action to enjoin infringement or
          other misuse of intellectual property rights is entitled to recover
          costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in pursuing that
          remedy. OPT-OUT: You may opt out of this mandatory arbitration
          provision by writing us within 60 calendar days of your agreement to
          this Arbitration Provision (b) by mail to 227 Lewis Wharf Boston, MA
          02110. Include your name, address, and date in the correspondence.
          This is the only way you can opt out.
          <br />
          Claims and Disputes Must be Filed Within One (1) Year
          <br />
          To the extent permitted by law, and without limiting the effect of any
          disclaimer contained herein, any cause of action or claim you may have
          concerning your use of the Services, including, without limitation,
          any website or mobile application or other Services-related product,
          services, or other content must be commenced within one (1) year after
          the claim or cause of action arises. This section applies to you and
          your heirs, successors, and assigns.

        <h1>21. General Provisions</h1>
        <p className="fs-5">
          A. Governing Law and Jurisdictionbr <br />
          These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed by the laws
          of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its
          conflict of laws principles.
          <br />
          B. Entire Agreement <br />
          These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and
          us and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior
          agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these
          Terms of Service).
          <br />
          C. No Agency <br />
          No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or
          franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these
          Terms of Service.
          <br />
          D. Severability <br />
          If any part of these Terms of Service is held invalid or
          unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent
          with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original
          intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions will remain in
          full force and effect.
          <br />
          E. No Waiver <br />
          Our failure to enforce any right or provisions in these Terms of
          Service will not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other
          provision of these Terms of Service. No waiver of any of the
          provisions of these Terms of Service is a waiver of any other
          provision, whether or not similar, nor does any waiver constitute a
          continuing waiver.
